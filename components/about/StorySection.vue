          An-Nadaa started with the renovation of a single school building in
          2014, since then it has grown into an organisation that has
          established Awqaaf and executed many projects and is building the
          community through education and welfare causes. An-Nadaa is an
          officially registered Non-Profit Organisation by the Malaysian and
          Nigerian governments.

          <br /><br />Our causes aim to build self-sustaining communities in
          which people who were once in need of support transform into someone
          who supports and uplifts others. Although we started off in Zaria city
          in Nigeria our vision is to cover the whole country and one day reach
          the whole of Africa.
