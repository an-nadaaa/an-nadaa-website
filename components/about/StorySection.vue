          <p class="text-dark-gray font-light">
            An-Nadaa started with the renovation of a single school building in
            2014, since then it has grown into an organisation that has
            established Awqaaf and executed many projects and is building the
            community through education and welfare causes. An-Nadaa is an
            officially registered Non-Profit Organisation by the Malaysian and
            Nigerian governments.

            <br /><br />Our causes aim to build self-sustaining communities in
            which people who were once in need of support transform into someone
            who supports and uplifts others. Although we started off in Zaria
            city in Nigeria our vision is to cover the whole country and one day
            reach the whole of Africa.

            Dr. Ibrahim Nuhu Tahir was born and raised in Nigeria. Sheikh
            started his Islamic education from a young age in the classical way
            with his father Dr. Nuhu Tahir (may Allah preserve him) and other
            scholars in that region. Sheikh Ibrahim enjoys being around children
            which is why he started off as a primary School headmaster at
            Raudatul Qurâ€™an School in Zaria city of Nigeria.

            Madinah. He graduated from the Dept of Shariah at the top of his
            class with his Bachelors in Shariah and Islamic Studies. He then
            followed that up with a Postgraduate Diploma (first class of
            honours) in Islamic Law and Islamic Political Science. Sheikh
            Ibrahim benefited greatly from his stay in this blessed city
            learning a lot from the knowledge and tarbiya of the scholars. This
            is where the idea of An-Nadaa was first developed.

            Sheikh Ibrahim allots a lot of his free time, and many times
            sacrifices his own family time, to engage with youth and spread the
            knowledge and the tarbiyyah of the deen. He conducts classes in
            Fiqh, Seerah, Akhlaaq, Tafseer, Faraid, essential knowledge for new

            organisations and student bodies. With his deep knowledge coupled
            with extreme humility, Sheikh Ibrahim has significantly
            single-handedly developed Islam in the lives of hundreds if not
            thousands of Muslim youth.
