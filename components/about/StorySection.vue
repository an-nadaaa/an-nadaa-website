          <p class="text-dark-gray font-light">
            An-Nadaa started with the renovation of a single school building in
            2014, since then it has grown into an organisation that has
            established Awqaaf and executed many projects and is building the
            community through education and welfare causes. An-Nadaa is an
            officially registered Non-Profit Organisation by the Malaysian and
            Nigerian governments.

            <br /><br />Our causes aim to build self-sustaining communities in
            which people who were once in need of support transform into someone
            who supports and uplifts others. Although we started off in Zaria
            city in Nigeria our vision is to cover the whole country and one day
            reach the whole of Africa.
