An-Nadaa started with the renovation of a single school building in 2014, since then it has grown into an organisation that has established Awqaaf and executed many projects and is building the community through education and welfare causes. An-Nadaa is an officially registered Non-Profit Organisation by the Malaysian and Nigerian governments.

Our causes aim to build self-sustaining communities in which people who were once in need of support transform into someone who supports and uplifts others. Although we started off in Zaria city in Nigeria our vision is to cover the whole country and one day reach the whole of Africa.
