## Do your Udhiya with An-Nadaa

An-Nadaa Educational Foundation, together with your support, is arranging Udhiya/Qurbani of cows this Eid ul Adha. We are fulfilling all Islamic principles and requirements as per Shari'ah. The meat will be distributed to the most poor and deserving families in and around Zaria, Nigeria. All you have to do is donate $100 for one share in a cow.

## Why should you Donate?

> "And when it is said to them, 'Spend from that which Allah has provided for you,' those who disbelieve say to those who believe, 'Should we feed one whom, if Allah had willed, He would have fed? You are not but in clear error.'"
>
> — The Noble Qur’an, 36:47

## Who do we distribute the meat to?

The meat is not distributed arbitrarily to anyone who inquires about it. It is only after careful research and proper verification that a list is formed of those who are the most needy. The preparation of this list is done with a lot of care so that meat reaches those who are genuinely deserving. Three methods are used by An-Nadaa to identify them:

1. Consulting the local imams of the masjid.
2. Consulting school and orphanage administrations of these localities.
3. Making our own research through our staff and volunteers who are closely connected to these communities.

## How can you support this project?

You can support this project by donating, making Du'aa for its success, and also by sharing with your friends, family, and whoever you expect to benefit from this project. Every little bit is important, whether it is a few cents, a Du'aa, or sharing with someone who makes a difference.
